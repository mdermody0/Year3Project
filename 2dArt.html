                    One of the first assignments we had was to make a character sheet showing a figure from various vantage points.
                    It was important to ensure that a side, front and back view of the same character was included as well as quarter turns from both back and front.
                    Not being an artist myself, and having very little experience in drawing people (or anything else!), this was an interesting challenge.

                    To try and lessen the difficulty in drawing a person, I decided to opt for a “superhero-like” character who used a mask to disguise themselves.
                    An easy way to get around drawing facial features/expressions!

                    The final assignment for my first year was to work with a team to create a game.
                    After dividing up the workload, I was in charge of creating the artwork for how the character would attack an enemy.
                    When we decided on a casino theme, I designed the attacks around the concept of playing cards being the method by which the player can attack their enemies.

                    Each card would be for a different damage type and would change dependent upon what their mode of attack was.
                    When creating the cards, I relied upon my own gaming experience to help me decide on how the character would attack and what affect it would have.
                    In the design phase, I needed to ensure that any object shown on the cards was small enough to fit appropriately in the space but large enough to be easily recognised.
