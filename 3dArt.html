                    This was the first time I had used 3D software or created any 3D modelling.
                    Our first assignment was to use MAYA to create a castle based upon the information contained in our brief.
                    Although we were only tasked with making one pillar, we were allowed to do whatever we wished with the castle after that.
                    This meant that we had to learn the importance of scale with 3D objects and the different short cuts available to use with MAYA in creating a 3D object.
                    I also learned how to use the different perspective options available with MAYA, which came in handy with later assignments.

                    In creating the book, I had to learn a few new skills associated with 3D modelling.
                    First, there was learning how to extrude in order to design the pages.
                    Then it was bevelling to show the rounded spine of the book.
                    I also had to learn how to use and face and edge tools to hollow out the guts of the book so that the pages could be put in place.
                    Finally, I learned how to apply colour to the specific areas of the book that required it. 
                    The main difficulty I faced was in my decision to create a buckle for the book.
                    It took a bit of work, and a good few attempts at buckles, before I figured out something that worked well.
