                    I decided to use the side view from my character sheet in order to animate the walk cycle. I felt this would be the easiest to use to create the animation and get the look I was hoping for.

                    This was the first time I animated something.
                    It was interesting to try and ensure that the character actually looked like it was moving fluidly.
                    This meant you needed to show the height difference as the body moved; the head bobbing slightly as the character went forward and that the body was slightly bouncing with each stride.
                    Overall, happy with the outcome however a few more frames would have made it look a little more natural.
